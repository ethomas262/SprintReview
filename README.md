# SprintReview
Sprint Review And Retrospective for Scrum SDLC

1. Interpreting user needs into actionable solutions for a development team to implement starts with creating a dialog between the users or some type of survey to figure out what value can be provided.
   After this we use the knowledge we gained to create user stories which are small bite sized chunks of information in the form of "As a user I want to... so that I can..." User stories ultimately point the developement team
   in the right direction and begin a dialog to figure out what functionality or solutions will be implemented and the best ways to go about producing the software or product.

2. The aspects of the agile process that I want to implement in my future work is how flow is priotorized and development is broken down into manageable packages which can be tested and deployed incrementally.
   This will allow me to better plan and incorporate solutions to my software whether I am working on personal projects or providing value.

3. A good team member in software developement not only pursues technical excellence in the technologies and practices used by the team and enterprise but also takes private ownership of products
   to provide secure, reliable, and scalable code that provides direct value to an enterprise or customer.
